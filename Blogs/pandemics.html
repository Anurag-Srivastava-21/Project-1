                <p> An infectious disease that spreads across international boundaries, affecting a large number of
                    people. For example, the most lethal pandemic recorded was The Plague(Black Death), killing up to
                    200
                    million people
                    worldwide in the 14th century. Talking about the epidemic, it is also an infectious disease that
                    rapidly
                    affects a large number of people in a community in a short period. For instance, the 2014 West
                    Africa
                    Ebola
                    epidemic.
                    Pandemic is an epidemic that has spread over much larger area with more severity.
                    Talking about the COVID-19, a disease caused by Coronavirus SARS-CoV2 is also declared a Pandemic

                <p>This life-threatening influenza lasted from October 1889 to December 1990. It was first recorded in
                    Bukhara, Russian Empire, in May 1889. By the end of the following year, it covered Northern America
                    and Africa. The reason behind the rapid spread was the modern transport infrastructure. The ravaging
                    flu took the lives of about 1 million people across the globe.

                <p>Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses containing single stranded RNA and are known to
                    infect
                    birds and mammals. 7 Coronaviruses can cause infection in human and out of them three can prove
                    fatal. These are- <br>
                    <br>

                    SARS-CoV2(Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2) is a novel (new & different type)
                    Coronavirus recognised as the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 that is COVID-19 that began
                    in Wuhan city in China in late 2019 and thereafter spread worldwide. <br>

                    MERS-CoV was the cause of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in 2012. <br>

                    SARS-CoV was recognised in 2003 and was the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome in
                    China at the end of 2002. <br>

                    Coronavirus cause acute, mild upper respiratory infection (common cold). It invades the
                    respiratory
                    tract via nose. Transmission is via airborne droplets. Spread occuring from person to person via
                    contact with respiratory droplets and nasal secretions. Patiens with symptoms (Symptomatic),
                    without
                    symptoms (Asymptomatic) and prior to symptoms (Presymptomatic) are known to cause infection. The
                    incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 days after exposure to virus. The risk of serious disease
                    and
                    death due to COVID-19 is more in immunocompromised patients and in people with lung, liver,
                    heart
                    and kidney diseases. Aged, obese and diabetic people have high risk of getting infected. At
                    initial
                    stage, the person suffers from common cold, sore-throat, fever and weakness.
                    The severity of disease is characterised by laboured breathing, hypoxia and extensive lung
                    involvement
                    which progresses to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilators. In addition to
                    respiratory
                    disease, it could progress to shock, multiorgan failure and ultimately death. <br>
                    <br>
                    The outbreak of
                    COVID-19 in late December 2019 started in Wuhan, China and was linked to an animal market which
                    suggested its transmission from animal(bats) to human. However, its origin is still
                    controversial. Since then it has spread worldwide.
                    The outbreak of COVID-19 is monitored by Centers for Disease Control & Prevention(CDC). Earlier
                    it was called an epidemic but its
                    worldwide invasion has led WHO (World Health Organisation) to declare it as a Pandemic.

                    Diarrhoea, vomiting or nausea may occur. Gastrointestinal problems are rare but may be seen.
                    The illness is more severe in people above 65years of age. People with medical conditions like
                    chronic lung disease, liver disease, serious heart disease, diabetes, obesity and
                    immunocompromised patients. People involved in medical facilities like nurses, doctors and staff
                    are more prone to infection.</p>

                    mouth
                    and nose is a mandatory prevention measure. Hand sanitizers and soaps are used to get rid of
                    infectious agents. Nationwide lockdown is followed for social distancing . A safe distance will
                    prevent the spread of the virus.
                    Basic measures include-
