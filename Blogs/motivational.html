                    <li>The very first thing of utmost important is the PURPOSE, the purpose behind each and everything
                        you do in life no matter what kind of task it is, if the purpose is not strong and genuine, it
                        is not going to push you for long.
                        Remember, the powerful the purpose, lesser the distraction.
                        For example, if you want to do something just to impress others, once they are impressed you
                        will quit.
                        So, give yourself a strong purpose and go ahead and achieve. </li>
                    <li>No doubt, interest in something also plays an important role as well, but when the purpose has a
                        stronger base it will compel you to achieve whatever you want.</li>
                    <li>Then comes the body and mind combination to deposit all your energy to generate successful
                        results, we will talk about each of them separately.</li>

                <p> Considering the mind first, mind is the cognitive (based on knowledge and understanding) as well as
                    non-cognitive thinking ability of brain.
                    There are multiple ways to complete a task, it depends on you how you analyse the situation and get
                    the easiest way out of the complex ones and accomplish the task.
                    To do this, you need to understand the pattern of how mind works, you have to connect those little
                    things and make mind your best friend and use it effectively in order to get things done.
                    An unclear mind can create problems while the clear one can give you success. It is said about the
                    mind that the kind of information we feed on; the same type of action comes out. So, always be aware
                    of the kind of information that enters your mind. <br>
                    <br>

                        yourself, because no one else is going to do it for you. </q>

                    <br>
                    Consider your mind as a powerful weapon and to get control over it is not that easy. The only way to
                    conquer the mind is by giving your thinking a right direction, by this we are not limiting the
                    thinking ability which is itself a very difficult task but we are just using them to get the things
                    done for us.
                    Always remember you cannot control your thinking, all you can do is to give your thinking a right
                    direction, and that will work. And with time you will generate a better idea of how mind works and
                    in turn have a better control over the mind. At times we want to stop our overthinking but
                    unfortunately, we can’t, then one thought leads to the other and the process continues. There
                    becomes a link between different unwanted thoughts and we end up with a foggy brain.
                    The very first curiosity of how mind works and how to use it to get things done for you will help
                    you achieve your goals and missions. Things don’t change overnight; it is a lifetime process of
                    observing and implementing. So why not start now and have a better tomorrow.

                <p> It is equally important to work on the body as on mind.
                    You cannot run a car at a speed of 150 miles/hr until you work on its engine, it is as simple as
                    that. You have to work on your body so that it can help your mind think properly and give you energy
                    to convert thoughts into actions.
                    Can you think of something clearly, if you have an upset stomach? I cannot.
                    Having big ambitions and feeling lethargic is not a good combination. Ever wondered why at times you
                    have mood swings? The body plays a major role in it, your body is having certain chemical reactions
                    which reduces the secretion of dopamine level (a chemical which makes you feel happy) in mind. In
                    order to feel enthusiastic and energetic you should work on your body and try consuming the food
                    that gives energy instead of degrading your energy and cutting off your full potential.
                    Try to develop a healthy lifestyle, you should be aware of what you are eating and in turn what your
                    body is responding to those foods. Try observing the little changes and the signal your body is
                    giving to you. Along with eating healthy you should feel healthy too. Once your body is fit your
                    mind will be balanced simultaneously. Anxiety is one of the biggest problems that 90% of the world’s
                    population is facing. A healthy lifestyle can fix this problem as well. As we all know being
                    impatient in anything will not deliver good results.
                    We do this mistake very often; we keep on thinking about our goals and ambitions and take less care
                    to think of our body. We always talk about the mindset, motivation and things required to focus the
                    mind but these alone cannot do wonders unless and until we have a body full of energy, capable of
                    doing tasks. Here is the list of some of the things which you can start doing to see the drastic
                    change in our body.
                <ul>
                    <li> Eat fresh and boiled food.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Stick more to the vegetarian food.</li>
                    <li>Take proper sleep.</li>
                    <li>Beware of the body signals and try working on it immediately.</li>
                    <li>Do exercise on daily basis.</li>
                    <li>It is important that your body should sweat once, daily.</li>
                    <li>Do at least half an hour of running and 1 hour walking daily.</li>
                    <li>Replenish your body with necessary fluid.</li>
                    <li>Drink 10 glasses of water daily. (may change from season to season)</li>
                    <li>Do Yoga daily, it can boost the immunity of your body as well as mind.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <div class="Info center">
                    <h2>Surrounding</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="image center">

                </div>
                <p> Another most important factor which plays a major role in goal achieving is the Surrounding, if you
                    surround yourself with people having same ambitions and goals, you have more chances of succeeding.
                    As we all know that a good company can change a person’s habit. By very human nature we adapt to our
                    surrounding. <br>
                    A very common example can be, if you find your roommate studying it will also motivate you to do so.
                    But sometimes it does happen that you don’t get a proper environment, at that time you should try to
                    develop that environment in your mind, try reading books and searching information that matches your
                    goal and encourages you.
